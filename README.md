# Social Media Misinformation Detection Algorithm

## Introduction
A prototype algorithm for detecting misinformation on social media, classifying posts into clickbait or factual errors. Built as a foundation for scalable, robust misinformation detection systems.

## Key Features

Content Classification: Detects clickbait and factual errors in social media posts

Pre-trained NLP Models: State-of-the-art transformer-based analysis

OCR Integration: Can process text from images in posts

Vector Search: Uses FAISS for efficient similarity matching

LangChain: Supports modular pipelines for text processing and analysis

Proof-of-Concept: Focused on algorithmic accuracy over scalability

## üìä Dataset & Metrics

Dataset Size: ~10,000 social media posts (scraped and self-labeled)

Clickbait Detection Accuracy: 81%

Factual Error Detection Accuracy: 75%

Overall Accuracy: 78%

Metrics are based on a prototype dataset and serve as proof-of-concept.

## üöÄ Challenges & Limitations

Not optimized for real-time or batch processing

Cosine similarity is a naive metric for clickbait detection

Limited labeled data restricts supervised learning performance

Currently supports text-only and image-extracted text; no video or multimedia content yet

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

Algorithm Improvements: Advanced embeddings and NLP techniques

Scalability: Optimize for batch and real-time processing

Multi-Modal Analysis: Extend to videos, images, and multimedia content

Account-Level Filtering: Detect users spreading misinformation

RLHF Integration: Adaptive learning from human feedback

Commercial-Grade UX: Build intuitive user interfaces for deployment

## ü§ù Contribution

We welcome contributions to:

Improve NLP detection models

Curate larger labeled datasets

Optimize for scalability and performance

Extend support for videos and multi-modal content
